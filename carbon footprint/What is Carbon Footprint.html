<p align="center" style = "font-family: 'ABeeZee', sans-serif;"><font size = "5"><br> &nbsp A carbon footprint is historically defined as the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization,&nbsp or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent. Greenhouse gases, including the carbon-containing gases carbon dioxide and methane, can be emitted through the burning of fossil fuels, land clearance and the production and consumption of food, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation and other services.</font></p><br>

<p align="center" style = "font-family: 'ABeeZee', sans-serif;"><font size = "5">In most cases, the total carbon footprint cannot be calculated exactly because of inadequate knowledge of and data about the complex interactions between contributing processes, including the influence of natural processes that store or release carbon dioxide. For this reason, Wright, Kemp, and Williams proposed the following definition of a carbon footprint:</font></p><br>

<p align="center" style = "font-family: 'ABeeZee', sans-serif;"><strong><font size = "5">"A measure of the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions of a defined population, system or activity, considering all relevant sources, sinks and storage within the spatial and temporal boundary of the population, system or activity of interest. Calculated as carbon dioxide equivalent using the relevant 100-year global warming potential (GWP100)."</font></strong></p><br>

<p align="center" style = "font-family: 'ABeeZee', sans-serif;"><font size = "5">&nbspMost of the carbon footprint emissions for the average U.S. household come from "indirect" sources, e.g. fuel burned to produce &nbspgoods far away from the final consumer. These are distinguished from emissions which come from burning fuel directly in one's car or stove, commonly referred to as "direct" sources of the consumer's carbon footprint.</font></p>
